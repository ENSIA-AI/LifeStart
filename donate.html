<h1>Stand with Gaza, Sudan, and Every Muslim in Need 🤍</h1>

<p>
  Our brothers and sisters in <strong>Gaza</strong> and <strong>Sudan</strong> are living through unimaginable suffering —
  homes destroyed, families displaced, children hungry, and lives torn apart by war and injustice.
</p>

<p>
  This website was created with one pure goal: <strong>to unite hearts and hands</strong> to help those who are struggling.
  Here, you can share stories of families in need, add verified links to support them directly, and inspire others to give.
</p>

<h2>🌿 Why We Must Help</h2>

<p>
  In <strong>Gaza</strong>, entire communities are left without food, clean water, or shelter. Hospitals are overwhelmed,
  and innocent lives are lost every day. Yet, their faith and resilience remain unshaken.
</p>

<p>
  In <strong>Sudan</strong>, thousands have fled their homes because of conflict and hunger.
  Children are growing up in uncertainty, dreaming of peace and education that every child deserves.
</p>

<p>
  And across the Muslim world — from <strong>Yemen</strong> to <strong>Syria</strong> and beyond — families continue to face poverty,
  displacement, and loss. Our Ummah is one body: when one part suffers, the rest must respond with mercy.
</p>

<h2>🤲 Our Mission</h2>
<p>
  This website exists to be a <strong>bridge of compassion</strong> — connecting people who want to help with families
  who need that help. Together, we can provide food, shelter, education, and hope.
</p>

<p>
  You can <strong>add families or communities in need</strong> with verified information and donation links,
  so others can reach them directly and securely. Every small act of giving becomes a light that shines in someone’s darkness.
</p>
