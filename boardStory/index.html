              <p> I never believed in religion. I trusted only science and reason. But the more I learned about the
                universe, the more I realized everything was too perfect to be by chance.
                I started reading about different religions, and Islam caught my attention.
                It didn’t ask me to stop thinking — it invited me to think more deeply.
                The Qur’an spoke to my mind. It said things like, “Do they not reflect?” and “Do they not look at the
                creation?”
                I spent months studying. Then one evening, I simply knew it — there is only One God.
                I whispered the Shahada alone in my room. I felt tears fall, not from sadness, but from truth.</p>

              <p> My life was falling apart. My parents were gone, my marriage was broken, and my soul was tired.
                I met an old Muslim woman who told me, “God tests those He loves.”
                She gave me a Qur’an in my language. I read it every night with tears.
                When I reached the verse, “Your Lord has not forsaken you,” I cried until dawn.
                I felt like Allah was talking directly to me, healing my heart word by word.
                That night, I accepted Islam. I didn’t feel alone anymore. Every prayer became a conversation with the
                One who never left me </p>

              <p> I grew up in a Christian family, but I always had questions no one could answer.
                I wanted to understand why God needed partners, why we prayed through someone instead of to Him.
                During my time in college, I met a Muslim roommate. He never argued; he just lived his faith calmly.
                I started asking him about Islam, and every answer made sense.
                He told me, “We worship the same God who sent Jesus, but we don’t associate anyone with Him.”
                That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about the simplicity of it all — One God.
                A week later, I went to the mosque and said the Shahada.
                I walked out feeling reborn — pure, light, and at peace.</p>

              <p><small>arjun.patel@oneness.in</small></p>
              <p> I was raised in a Hindu family in India, surrounded by temples and rituals.
                I respected all beliefs but always wondered why there were so many gods.
                When I went to university, I met a Muslim roommate. He prayed five times a day, no matter how busy he
                was.
                I once asked him, “How can you be sure your way is right?”
                He smiled and said, “Because it’s the way of pure monotheism — one Creator, one purpose.”
                That answer stayed in my heart.
                I started reading about Islam and the Qur’an’s explanation of creation and life.
                It was simple and beautiful.
                One morning, I stood alone in my dorm and said the Shahada.
                Now, every time I pray, I feel closer to the One I had been searching for all my life.

              <p> At university, I used to watch Muslims praying between classes. The way they bowed and whispered so
                humbly made me wonder what they were feeling.
                I started reading about Islam just out of curiosity. But the more I read, the more I felt something
                awakening inside me.
                One Friday, I attended a sermon. I didn’t understand all the words, but the recitation touched my soul.
                I went home and cried for hours. Then I said the Shahada.
                My name changed later, but my heart changed first.
                Now every day feels like a new beginning, guided by Allah.</p>

              </p>
              <p> I had always been searching for meaning and peace in life. One day, I met an old friend who seemed
                calm and kind. He told me that his peace came from faith and gave me a small copy of the Qur’an.

                I started reading it every night, and the words touched my heart. Over time, I visited the mosque, met
                new people, and saw how Islam teaches honesty, kindness, and compassion.

                After months of learning and reflection, I decided to say the Shahada (the declaration of faith). It
                wasn't a sudden change, but a peaceful decision that gave my life purpose and calmness.

                Now, faith helps me to be more patient, grateful, and caring toward others every day.
